# CS499 Computer Science Capstone Overview
Hello! My name is Robert Lowrey (he/him), and I am a Dean’s List student majoring in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. In this e-portfolio I will cover an artifact that has been enhanced in three categories, Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. In my studies, I have developed a strong foundation that allows me to apply theoretical concepts to practical challenges. I am excited to showcase this artifact and demonstrate how it has prepared me for advanced applications and future endeavors in the field of computer science.

### Professional Self-Assessment

  For the past eleven years, I have worked as a Certified Pharmacy Technician. One day, while working, I had the urge to change my career to something more challenging and impactful. This desired change would require me to think critically and creatively about solutions to problems. I then explored the programs offered to full-time employees by my current employer, which led me to Computer Science. Upon researching career opportunities in this field, I was immediately convinced that this was the change that I needed. I have been enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since August 2022. When I enrolled in the program, I had very little experience with application development. I had taken a programming class in high school but transferred to a different elective after a week, which I deeply regret. The time I have spent in the Computer Science program has further developed my passion for technology and I have found fulfillment through analyzing data and developing programs. 
  Upon starting the program, I knew that my future would involve long and sleepless nights of studying and implementing what I had learned into my assignments, but I was ready for the challenge. Needless to say, there were numerous times when I cried in the middle of the night out of frustration and questioned myself “Why did I do this to myself?” and “Is it really worth it?” due to the complications I faced with my assignments. I had no personal connections to reach out to with questions; however, I did have my professors. They were the most reliable help I could have asked for during this learning process. They stayed up late with me, explaining the concepts that I could not understand. I was able to tackle my assignments one at a time, and research various ways to approach solutions which has allowed me to succeed with every class I have taken.
  While enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained a deep understanding of agile methodologies since I have constantly implemented them in my studies. All the courses I have taken have had assignments due at midnight on Sunday. Therefore, my classmates and I would undergo sprints and collaborate in an online team environment to resolve the ambiguous requirements set by the stakeholders (professors).  We would also communicate with the stakeholders and implement any given feedback into our deliverables to meet the requirements efficiently. Fortunately, I had taken CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) previously, which taught me how to discuss requirements with stakeholders and communicate what is being asked effectively. 
  Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has enabled me to showcase my strengths by requiring me to utilize various artifacts and languages to accomplish industry-specific goals. When I started the program, the first language I learned was Python which made me feel like the course was going to be a breeze; however, once I was introduced to C++, the sleepless nights started, and all of my questions kept me up at night. After gaining some familiarity with C++ I learned how to develop in Java, and it felt like I could sleep again because most concepts were easier to understand. I felt like it was C++ but simplified (at least this is how it was for me).  I then became more comfortable in Python and Java. Upon further research, many companies utilize Python for data analysis and Java for software development. Therefore, due to my excitement about entering the Data Analysis/Engineering field of Computer Science, I wanted to further enhance my Python skills by applying it to the Travel Destination Application. 
  Knowing how to structure an application and utilize the correct algorithms to determine the appropriate trade-offs is vital. This is where the CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms course came into play. In this course, I learned how to implement advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem-solving. 
While we did not utilize a NoSQL database in my Computer Science program, I wanted to implement one to showcase my willingness to expand my knowledge and grow in the Computer Science field. Fortunately, I had taken CS-340 Client/Server Development where I learned how to apply database system concepts and principles to applications that interface with client-side code. By implementing the knowledge gained in this class, I was able to integrate the NoSQL database into the Travel Destination Application. Additionally, since I had no prior experience with a NoSQL database, I wanted to showcase my skills and growth by creating a local MongoDB Compass database to enhance the Travel Destination Application. Integrating the knowledge gained from this specific course demonstrates my ability to organize the data collection and interact with the application for a smoother experience. I have also added extra features for security that were not part of the original Java application.  
  Security is of utmost importance when developing any application. It begins with the design phase and continues throughout the application’s lifecycle. Programming defensively is one of the best and most vital approaches to protecting a program from malicious users and unanticipated behavior from the program itself. I completed my CS-405 Secure Coding course before starting this CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course. In the Secure Coding course, I learned how to focus on common security vulnerabilities found within software. I gained the ability to integrate strategies and techniques to develop both robust and secure code while leveraging secure programming principles. With this in mind, I implemented the Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy into the Python application, specifically in how the passwords are stored in the database as a salted hash. I also -developed the Travel Destination Application with malicious users in mind and integrated input validation and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage the deletion of users in the database. 
  In conclusion, I developed the Travel Destination Application artifact early on in my Computer Science program during my enrollment in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course. I have utilized this application to demonstrate my proficiency in three areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Each enhancement to the artifact is interconnected and builds upon the previous one for the Python application to form my ePortfolio as a whole. This project highlights the progress I’ve made throughout my Computer Science journey, showing how I took an initial Java application and enhanced it through this Capstone course. It reflects my dedication and growth as I’ve worked to learn various programming languages and tackle the challenges along the way.
