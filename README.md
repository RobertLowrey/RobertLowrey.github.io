# CS499 Computer Science Capstone Overview
Hello! My name is Robert Lowrey (he/him), and I am a Dean’s List student majoring in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. In this e-portfolio I will cover an artifact that has been enhanced in three categories, Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. In my studies, I have developed a strong foundation that allows me to apply theoretical concepts to practical challenges. I am excited to showcase this artifact and demonstrate how it has prepared me for advanced applications and future endeavors in the field of computer science.
