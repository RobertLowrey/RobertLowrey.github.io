### Professional Self-Assessment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past eleven years, I have worked as a Certified Pharmacy Technician. One day, while working, I had the urge to change my career to something more challenging and impactful. This desired change would require me to think critically and creatively about solutions to problems. I then explored the programs offered to full-time employees by my current employer, which led me to Computer Science. Upon researching career opportunities in this field, I was immediately convinced that this was the change that I needed. I have been enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since August 2022. When I enrolled in the program, I had very little experience with application development. I had taken a programming class in high school but transferred to a different elective after a week, which I deeply regret. The time I have spent in the Computer Science program has further developed my passion for technology and I have found fulfillment through analyzing data and developing programs.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon starting the program, I knew that my future would involve long and sleepless nights of studying and implementing what I had learned into my assignments, but I was ready for the challenge. Needless to say, there were numerous times when I cried in the middle of the night out of frustration and questioned myself “Why did I do this to myself?” and “Is it really worth it?” due to the complications I faced with my assignments. I had no personal connections to reach out to with questions; however, I did have my professors. They were the most reliable help I could have asked for during this learning process. They stayed up late with me, explaining the concepts that I could not understand. I was able to tackle my assignments one at a time, and research various ways to approach solutions which has allowed me to succeed with every class I have taken.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained a deep understanding of agile methodologies since I have constantly implemented them in my studies. All the courses I have taken have had assignments due at midnight on Sunday. Therefore, my classmates and I would undergo sprints and collaborate in an online team environment to resolve the ambiguous requirements set by the stakeholders (professors).  We would also communicate with the stakeholders and implement any given feedback into our deliverables to meet the requirements efficiently. Fortunately, I had taken CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) previously, which taught me how to discuss requirements with stakeholders and communicate what is being asked effectively. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has enabled me to showcase my strengths by requiring me to utilize various artifacts and languages to accomplish industry-specific goals. When I started the program, the first language I learned was Python which made me feel like the course was going to be a breeze; however, once I was introduced to C++, the sleepless nights started, and all of my questions kept me up at night. After gaining some familiarity with C++ I learned how to develop in Java, and it felt like I could sleep again because most concepts were easier to understand. I felt like it was C++ but simplified (at least this is how it was for me).  I then became more comfortable in Python and Java. Upon further research, many companies utilize Python for data analysis and Java for software development. Therefore, due to my excitement about entering the Data Analysis/Engineering field of Computer Science, I wanted to further enhance my Python skills by applying it to the Travel Destination Application. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Knowing how to structure an application and utilize the correct algorithms to determine the appropriate trade-offs is vital. This is where the CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms course came into play. In this course, I learned how to implement advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem-solving. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While we did not utilize a NoSQL database in my Computer Science program, I wanted to implement one to showcase my willingness to expand my knowledge and grow in the Computer Science field. Fortunately, I had taken CS-340 Client/Server Development where I learned how to apply database system concepts and principles to applications that interface with client-side code. By implementing the knowledge gained in this class, I was able to integrate the NoSQL database into the Travel Destination Application. Additionally, since I had no prior experience with a NoSQL database, I wanted to showcase my skills and growth by creating a local MongoDB Compass database to enhance the Travel Destination Application. Integrating the knowledge gained from this specific course demonstrates my ability to organize the data collection and interact with the application for a smoother experience. I have also added extra features for security that were not part of the original Java application.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Security is of utmost importance when developing any application. It begins with the design phase and continues throughout the application’s lifecycle. Programming defensively is one of the best and most vital approaches to protecting a program from malicious users and unanticipated behavior from the program itself. I completed my CS-405 Secure Coding course before starting this CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course. In the Secure Coding course, I learned how to focus on common security vulnerabilities found within software. I gained the ability to integrate strategies and techniques to develop both robust and secure code while leveraging secure programming principles. With this in mind, I implemented the Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy into the Python application, specifically in how the passwords are stored in the database as a salted hash. I also -developed the Travel Destination Application with malicious users in mind and integrated input validation and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage the deletion of users in the database. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In conclusion, I developed the Travel Destination Application artifact early on in my Computer Science program during my enrollment in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course. I have utilized this application to demonstrate my proficiency in three areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Each enhancement to the artifact is interconnected and builds upon the previous one for the Python application to form my ePortfolio as a whole. This project highlights the progress I’ve made throughout my Computer Science journey, showing how I took an initial Java application and enhanced it through this Capstone course. It reflects my dedication and growth as I’ve worked to learn various programming languages and tackle the challenges along the way.

### Category One: Software Design and Engineering 

[RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryOne](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryOne)

**Justification of inclusion for Category One:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The reason why I chose this artifact is because it was going to be a challenge for me. Meaning that I have not written a Python project in months, so I thought it would be a great refresher for the language overall. It is also a learning curve because I have never used the Tkinter library in Python to implement pictures with individual descriptions to a Python project. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	Within the enhanced artifact there are components that showcase my skills as a developer. One skill that it showcases is an understanding of the Python language overall because I was able to take an artifact that was written originally in Java language and port it to Python. Another skill shown is that I am able to create a subplot of pictures along with individual descriptions for each image. With the implementation of this design, I was able to change the background of the output window to display a lighter shade of gray and align the description of each destination with the image it corresponds to. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This artifact was improved by way of changing the overall background color of the destinations along with their descriptions. This change makes the description more readable. Another improvement that I have implemented was adding more travel destinations as well as the best time to visit each destination. Lastly, the background color of the image and corresponding description changes when the user clicks on either the image or the description.


### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure 

[RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryTwo](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryOne)

**Justification of inclusion for Category Two:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I selected this item to enhance further because I wanted to learn more about the Tkinter library in Python. I was eager to learn how to implement more functionality within the library, and I thought that this was a perfect opportunity to do so. Additionally, with the enhanced functionality, I was able to learn new things, such as optimizing the search algorithm and developing the application the way I had envisioned. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The enhancements to the artifact showcase my skills and abilities in development with the implementation of a search query, which demonstrates best coding practices. The enhancement of a linear search algorithm within the application mitigates redundant iterations through the code while displaying the destination images and descriptions. With this being said, the optimization of the average search algorithm in Big-O notation is O(n), while the best case is O(1).

### Category Three: Databases

[RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryThree](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryOne)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The artifact that I chose for this category is a Java program featuring multiple travel destinations. Each destination includes a picture and a description. It was created in March 2023, during my enrollment in the CS–250 Software Development Lifecycle course. I believe this project would be a great candidate for further enhancement to meet this category's requirements. For the previous milestone, I ported the Java application to Python, added more destinations, expanded the descriptions, and implemented a feature where clicking on a destination’s image or description changes the background color to highlight the selected row.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For this category, I further enhanced the artifact by implementing a feature that hides the travel destinations window until the user logs in with the correct username and password. Once the user clicks the login button, they are authenticated, and the window displaying the list of destinations appears. Within the travel destinations window, I also added a search bar that allows users to search for keywords in either the images or descriptions. After clicking the “Search Destinations” button, the query undergoes a linear search to display the images and descriptions containing the specified keyword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I chose this artifact because working on the enhancement of the database implementation would reintroduce me to the process of integrating a database within a Python project. It was also a new learning experience when it came to the Bcrypt library implementation, which helped familiarize me with creating a salted hash password before storing it in the database for an additional layer of security. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The enhancements that I have implemented showcase my skills and abilities in software development by maintaining a connection to a NoSQL database that stores usernames and passwords for different users. Another skill demonstrated by this enhancement is the ability to salt hashed passwords for an extra layer of security. Lastly, these enhancements highlight my technical proficiency in data modeling using tools applied during both the database and RBAC implementation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The implementation of the database aligns with course outcome number four by using well-founded and innovative techniques that deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals of storing usernames and passwords in the NoSQL database. Additionally, the RBAC allows the ‘Admin’ role to delete users from the database by selecting their username in the ‘Admin Window’.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I also align with course outcome number one, which focuses on employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making. This is achieved through the utilization of MongoDB. Since MongoDB is scalable and flexible, it enables future developers to contribute to new implementations. It can also enable multiple users to work on the same project to analyze, collectively improve and update the database. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The account creation feature aligns with course outcome number five by developing a security mindset that anticipates exploits in software architecture and design. This is achieved because passwords are stored as a salted hash in the database. As previously mentioned, when creating an account, the individual must enter their password twice using the correct capitalization and spelling when entering each one; otherwise, an error message will populate indicating that the passwords do not match. As of now, I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned a lot from implementing the NoSQL database in the artifact. I received a refresher on how to integrate MongoDB into a Python program. Additionally, I learned how to incorporate an account creation window that allows users to create usernames and passwords in the database. I also learned how to share a local MongoDB Compass database for others to view and utilize. Another concept I learned from this enhancement was how to use the Bcrypt library within Python to salt hashed passwords before storing them in the database. Furthermore, I learned how to remove unnecessary white space from user entries to ensure that only meaningful data is stored in the database. Lastly, I learned how to incorporate RBAC in the application to enable different types of access based on the roles that the user can choose from. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	I faced some challenges along the way, one of which was having to change both my original plan and artifact for this enhancement. I originally chose to implement a database within an Android Studio project; however, my Android Studio development tool was no longer able to run the artifact that I wanted to enhance. After troubleshooting the issue for several days, I decided to change my artifact for this enhancement. The last challenge I faced was sharing the local database for submission. I eventually found, through extensive research, that exporting the collection to a JSON or CSV file to submit would be sufficient for viewing and accessing the database.
