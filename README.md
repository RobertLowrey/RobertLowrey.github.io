### Professional Self-Assessment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For the past eleven years, I have worked as a Certified Pharmacy Technician. One day, while working, I had the urge to change my career to something more challenging and impactful. This desired change would require me to think critically and creatively about solutions to problems. I then explored the programs offered to full-time employees by my current employer, which led me to Computer Science. Upon researching the available career opportunities in this field, I was immediately convinced that this was the change that I needed. I have been enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since August 2022. When I enrolled in the program, I had very little experience with application development. I had taken a programming class in high school but transferred to a different elective after a week, which I deeply regret. The time I have spent in the Computer Science program has further developed my passion for technology and I have found fulfillment through analyzing data and developing programs.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Upon starting the program, I knew that my future would involve long and sleepless nights of studying and implementing what I had learned into my assignments, but I was ready for the challenge. Needless to say, there were numerous times when I cried in the middle of the night out of frustration and questioned “Why did I do this to myself?” and “Is it really worth it?” due to the complications I faced with my assignments. I had no personal connections to reach out to with questions; however, I did have my professors. They were the most reliable help I could have asked for during this learning process. They stayed up late with me, explaining the concepts that I could not understand. I was able to tackle my assignments one at a time and research various ways to approach solutions which has allowed me to succeed with every class I have taken.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	While enrolled in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained a deep understanding of agile methodologies since I have constantly implemented them in my studies. All of the courses I have taken have had assignments due at midnight on Sunday. Therefore, my classmates and I would undergo sprints and collaborate in an online team environment to resolve the ambiguous requirements set by the stakeholders (professors).  We would also communicate with the stakeholders and implement any given feedback into our deliverables to meet the requirements efficiently. Fortunately, I had taken the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) course previously, which taught me how to discuss requirements with stakeholders and communicate what is being asked effectively. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has enabled me to showcase my strengths by requiring me to utilize various artifacts and languages to accomplish industry-specific goals. When I started the program, the first language I learned was Python which made me feel like the course was going to be a breeze. However, once I was introduced to C++, the sleepless nights began, and all of my questions kept me up at night. After gaining some familiarity with C++ I learned how to develop in Java, and it felt like I could sleep again because most concepts were easier to understand. I felt like it was C++ but simplified (at least this is how it was for me).  I then became more comfortable in Python and Java. Upon further research, many companies utilize Python for data analysis and Java for software development. Therefore, due to my excitement about entering the Data Analysis/Engineering field of Computer Science, I wanted to further enhance my Python skills by applying it to the Travel Destination Application. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Knowing how to structure an application and utilize the correct algorithms to determine the appropriate trade-offs is vital. This is where the CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms course came into play. In this course, I learned how to implement advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem-solving. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	While we did not utilize a NoSQL database in my Computer Science program, I wanted to implement one to showcase my willingness to expand my knowledge and grow in the Computer Science field. Fortunately, I had taken the CS-340 Client/Server Development course where I learned how to apply database system concepts and principles to applications that interface with the client-side code. By implementing the knowledge gained in this class, I was able to integrate the NoSQL database into the Travel Destination Application. Additionally, since I had no prior experience with a NoSQL database, I wanted to showcase my skills and growth by creating a local MongoDB Compass database to enhance the Travel Destination Application. Integrating the knowledge gained from this specific course demonstrates my ability to organize data and interact with the application for a smoother user experience. I have also added extra features for security that were not part of the original Java application.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Security is of utmost importance when developing any application. It begins with the design phase and continues throughout the application’s lifecycle. Programming defensively is one of the best and most vital approaches to protecting a program from malicious users and unanticipated behavior from the program itself. I completed my CS-405 Secure Coding course before starting this CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course. In the Secure Coding course, I learned how to focus on common security vulnerabilities found within software. I gained the ability to integrate strategies and techniques to develop both robust and secure code while leveraging secure programming principles. With this in mind, I implemented the Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy into the Python application, specifically in how the passwords are stored in the database as a salted hash. I also developed the Travel Destination Application with malicious users in mind and integrated input validation and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage the deletion of users in the database. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In conclusion, I developed the Travel Destination Application artifact early on in my Computer Science program during my enrollment in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course. I have utilized this application to demonstrate my proficiency in three areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Each enhancement to the artifact is interconnected and builds upon the previous one for the Python application to form my ePortfolio as a whole. This project highlights the progress that I have made throughout my Computer Science journey, showing how I took an initial Java application and enhanced it throughout this Capstone Course. It reflects my dedication and growth as I’ve worked to learn various programming languages and tackle any challenges along the way.

### Code Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZFJ6WAVCOc) is a link to my Code Review Video on YouTube where I discuss the functionality of each existing artifact, conduct code analysis, and look for potential enhancements.

<a name="custom_java_name"></a>

### Original Java Artifact

  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	[Here](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-250_OriginalJavaArtifact) is my Original Java Artifact from the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) course. This artifact displays a list of the top five travel destinations written in Java Language in Eclipse.

### Enhancement Plan

[Enhancement Plan](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/blob/main/Word%20Documents/Robert%20Lowrey%20_CS-499_%20Enhancement%20Plan.docx)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I chose an artifact from the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course for the Enhancement Plan. This artifact displays a list of top five travel destinations. When the Java application is run, it presents a list of top five destinations with a picture and description. Upon clicking a specific destination, you will notice that the background of the selected row changes.

<a name="custom_software_name"></a>

### Category One: Software Design and Engineering 

[Category One Enhancement](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryOne)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/blob/main/ePortfolio%20Images/PyCharm.png" target="_blank">
		<img src="ePortfolio Images/PyCharm.png" width="200px" /> </a> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The artifact that I chose to meet this category is a Java program that has multiple travel destinations. Each destination has a picture with a description. It was created in March 2023, when I was enrolled in the CS–250 Software Development Lifecycle course, and I thought that this would be a good project to port to a new language.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The reason why I chose this artifact is because it was going to be a challenge for me. Meaning that I have not written a Python project in months, so I thought it would be a great refresher for the language overall. It is also a learning curve because I have never used the Tkinter library in Python to implement pictures with individual descriptions to a Python project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Within the enhanced artifact there are components that showcase my skills as a developer. One skill that it showcases is an understanding of the Python language overall because I was able to take an artifact that was written originally in Java language and port it to Python. Another skill shown is that I am able to create a subplot of pictures along with individual descriptions for each image. With the implementation of this design, I was able to change the background of the output window to display a lighter shade of gray and align the description of each destination with the image it corresponds to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	This artifact was improved by way of changing the overall background color of the destinations along with their descriptions. This change makes the description more readable. Another improvement that I have implemented was adding more travel destinations as well as the best time to visit each destination. Lastly, the background color of the image and corresponding description changes when the user clicks on either the image or the description.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have met most of the course outcomes that were planned in Module One with this enhancement. A course outcome I align with is number two, which is designing and developing professional-quality written communications that are coherent and technically sound with inline comments throughout the Python project. Another course outcome that I align with from this enhancement is outcome number three, which is achieving computing solutions that solve a problem using principles and Computer Science practices that are appropriate for the language. Therefore, I have met the planned course outcomes with this enhancement. I was successfully able to port this project into Python language and meet the two planned course outcomes that were discussed in the Module One Enhancement Plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One thing I have learned from the enhancement of this artifact was how to work with the Python language again. It was a great refresher, and it has made me feel confident as a developer. I honestly thought that I forgot everything about the language, but it turns out, I was incorrect about my assumptions. I was introduced to a new Python library while working on the enhancements of this category, which was the Tkinter library. With this library I learned how to create canvas structures and grids to display the pictures with the appropriate corresponding description labels. Another thing I learned was how to create functionality within Python which enables the user to click on the image or description of the image, and when they do so the background changes color to indicate that the row is selected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I did face challenges with this milestone, one being that I had to learn a whole new library to enable me to complete this application enhancement appropriately. Another challenge that I faced with this milestone is that I have been receiving a warning of unexpected arguments on two lines that I am having trouble figuring out. In my research, I have found that a possible solution would be to interchange “background” to “bg” and “event” to “widget” but when I have implemented these changes as suggested, I am still receiving the same warning. Therefore, I am led to believe that this warning is not critical to the overall application functionality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Another challenge I faced was implementing the scroll wheel functionality, but after researching this option I decided to enhance the artifact another way to make it easier for the users to scroll through the output window. Meaning that they can scroll through the page with their mouse, rather than having to hover above the actual scroll bar within the right side of the window.

### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure 

[Category Two Enhancement](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryTwo)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/blob/main/ePortfolio%20Images/CodeSnippet.png" target="_blank">
		<img src="ePortfolio Images/CodeSnippet.png" width="700px" /> </a> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The artifact that I chose for this category is a Java program featuring multiple travel destinations. Each destination includes a picture and a description. It was created in March 2023, during my enrollment in the CS–250 Software Development Lifecycle course. I believe this project would be a great candidate for further enhancement to meet this category's requirements. For the previous milestone, I ported the Java application to Python, added more destinations, expanded the descriptions, and implemented a feature where clicking on a destination’s image or description changes the background color to highlight the selected row. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For this category, I further enhanced the artifact by implementing a feature that hides the travel destinations window until the user logs in with the correct username and password. Once the user clicks the login button, they are authenticated, and the window displaying the list of destinations appears. Within the travel destinations window, I also added a search bar that allows users to search for keywords in either the images or descriptions. After clicking the “Search Destinations” button, the query undergoes a linear search to display the images and descriptions containing the specified keyword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I selected this item to enhance further because I wanted to learn more about the Tkinter library in Python. I was eager to learn how to implement more functionality within the library, and I thought that this was a perfect opportunity to do so. Additionally, with the enhanced functionality, I was able to learn new things, such as optimizing the search algorithm and developing the application the way I had envisioned. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The enhancements to the artifact showcase my skills and abilities in development with the implementation of a search query, which demonstrates best coding practices. The enhancement of a linear search algorithm within the application mitigates redundant iterations through the code while displaying the destination images and descriptions. With this being said, the optimization of the average search algorithm in Big-O notation is O(n), while the best case is O(1). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have met all of the planned course outcomes from my Module One Enhancement Plan. A course outcome I align with is number three, which is the utilization of algorithmic principles, Computer Science practices, and standards appropriate to its solution while managing trade-offs. I met this outcome by implementing a search feature within the application. This feature utilizes a linear search algorithm, which enhances the overall optimization of the artifact. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I align with course outcome number four, which is to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value. This course outcome was met by organization of data structures, including classes and functions that handle the programs behavior correctly. This ensures that any search algorithm or login feature functions as anticipated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The login feature aligns with course outcome number five, which is developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and design. This is met because the user has to log in with the correct credentials and be authenticated before the travel destination window is displayed. Lastly, the user must use the correct capitalization when entering their login information, otherwise an error window will appear, notifying the user of an incorrect username or password.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One thing that I learned from this enhancement was how to incorporate a linear search algorithm that reduces redundancy iterating through images and descriptions to enhance optimization. Another concept that I have learned with this enhancement was how to implement a login functionality which allows the login window to be displayed before the Top Travel Destinations window appears. I also learned how to create a search bar, along with integrating correct login functionality within a Python application. In my past educational experiences, I have not worked with these functionalities. Therefore, I am glad I was able to incorporate them effectively within the application. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I did face some challenges along the way with this enhancement, one of which was learning new functionalities for implementation. Another challenge I encountered was three weak warnings within the code; however, the weak warnings do not affect the behavior of the program in any way. Therefore, I am under the assumption that they are not vital to the functionality of the application.

### Category Three: Databases

[Category Three Enhancement](https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/tree/main/RobertLowrey_CS-499_CategoryThree)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://github.com/RobertLowrey/RobertLowrey.github.io/blob/main/ePortfolio%20Images/MongoDB.png" target="_blank">
		<img src="ePortfolio Images/MongoDB.png" width="300px" /> </a> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The artifact that I chose to meet this enhancement category is the same Python application that I have been working on. It was originally created in March 2023, during my enrollment in the CS–250 Software Development Lifecycle course. For the Software Engineering and Design enhancement, I ported the Java application to Python. Additionally, I added more destinations, expanded the descriptions, and implemented a feature where clicking on a destination’s image or description changes the background color to highlight the selected row. For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I implemented a feature that hides the travel destinations window until the user logs into the application with the correct username and password.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For this enhancement, I implemented a local NoSQL database using MongoDB Compass to store the usernames and passwords of users who create an account within the application. Therefore, to view the travel destinations, the user must have an account that is stored in the database. If the user is new to the application, they can click the “Create Account” button which will generate a window. Within the window, the individual can create a username, password, and role to be stored in the database. The chosen password must be entered twice to verify that the spelling and capitalization is correct. When the account creation is successful, the password is stored with a salted hash in the database, and the user can sign into the application to view the travel destinations. Additionally, I have added role-based access control (RBAC), where the ‘Admin’ role can delete selected users from the MongoDB database.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I chose this artifact because working on the enhancement of the database implementation would reintroduce me to the process of integrating a database within a Python project. It was also a new learning experience when it came to the Bcrypt library implementation, which helped familiarize me with creating a salted hash password before storing it in the database for an additional layer of security. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The enhancements that I have implemented showcase my skills and abilities in software development by maintaining a connection to a NoSQL database that stores usernames and passwords for different users. Another skill demonstrated by this enhancement is the ability to salt hashed passwords for an extra layer of security. Lastly, these enhancements highlight my technical proficiency in data modeling using tools and best practices applied during both the database and RBAC implementation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have met all of the planned course outcomes from my Module One Enhancement Plan. The implementation of the database aligns with course outcome number four by using well-founded and innovative techniques that deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals of storing usernames and passwords in the NoSQL database. Additionally, the RBAC allows the ‘Admin’ role to delete users from the database by selecting their username in the ‘Admin Window’.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I also align with course outcome number one, which focuses on employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making. This is achieved through the utilization of MongoDB. Since MongoDB is scalable and flexible, it enables future developers to contribute to new implementations. It can also enable multiple users to work on the same project to analyze, collectively improve and update the database.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The account creation feature aligns with course outcome number five by developing a security mindset that anticipates exploits in software architecture and design. This is achieved because passwords are stored as a salted hash in the database. As previously mentioned, when creating an account, the individual must enter their password twice using the correct capitalization and spelling when entering each one; otherwise, an error message will populate indicating that the passwords do not match. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have learned a lot from implementing the NoSQL database in the artifact. I received a refresher on how to integrate MongoDB into a Python program. Additionally, I learned how to incorporate an account creation window that allows users to create usernames and passwords in the database. I also learned how to share a local MongoDB Compass database for others to view and utilize. Another concept I learned from this enhancement was how to use the Bcrypt library within Python to salt hashed passwords before storing them in the database. Furthermore, I learned how to remove unnecessary white space from user entries to ensure that only meaningful data is stored in the database. Lastly, I learned how to incorporate RBAC in the application to enable different types of access based on the roles that the user can choose from. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I faced some challenges along the way, one of which was having to change both my original plan and artifact for this enhancement. I originally chose to implement a database within an Android Studio project; however, my Android Studio development tool was no longer able to run the artifact that I wanted to enhance. After troubleshooting the issue for several days, I decided to change my artifact for this enhancement. The last challenge I faced was sharing the local database for submission. I eventually found, through extensive research, that exporting the collection to a JSON or CSV file to submit would be sufficient for viewing and accessing the database.
