The intent with this MongoDB Compass NoSQL database named TravelDestinationDatabase is to store the usernames and passwords of the different users that will utilize this application. The usernames are all unique and the passwords are stored in the userInfo collection as a salted hash for an extra layer of security. With the implementation of the database, I was able to apply the Defense-in-Depth cybersecurity strategy to protect the users' information.
